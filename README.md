# Ableton Live 9 Mapping for the Traktor Kontrol S4

An Ableton Live 9.5 Custom MIDI Remote Script for the Native Instruments Traktor Kontrol S4 mk1.

# Background

This mapping is designed to support my specific workflow, though that workflow has a lot of built in flexibility:

1. All tracks are mixed down to 4 Main Bus tracks, assumed to be the first 4 tracks in the song
2. Each of the 4 Main Bus tracks has 3 Audio Effect Racks with at least macros 1-4 mapped
3. There are 3 send busses
4. The output of send busses comes into a Return Bus track, assumed to be the 5th track in the song

# Features

* Master Loop Play, Undo (Stop), Rec, and Size (Overdub) mapped to Transport
* Crossfader mapped to Crossfader
* Tracks 1-4 in song automatically mapped to Channels 3, 1, 2, and 4 respectively
* Volume slider controls volume
* VU meters show levels from Tracks 1-4
* Filter knob controls Macro 1 on the first Audio Effects Group on each track
* Hi/Mid/Low knobs control Sends 1/2/3
* Pressing the gain knob resets to "sends" mode
* Cue button enabled "fx1" mode
    * Hi/Mid/Low/Filter knobs control Macros 4/3/2/1 on the first Audio Effects Group
* Cue button enabled "fx2" mode
    * Hi/Mid/Low/Filter knobs control Macros 4/3/2/1 on the second Audio Effects Group
* Cue button enabled "fx3" mode
    * Hi/Mid/Low/Filter knobs control Macros 4/3/2/1 on the third Audio Effects Group

# Future

Well, there's a lot of additional buttons, knobs, sliders, and jog wheels which could do some cool stuff...
